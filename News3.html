        <p class="Para"> I studied Civil Engineering during 1959-63 from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi. During those days admissions were only in Civil, Electrical and Mechnical branches and 90 students in each, thus a total of 270 students. 
            There were four hostels names 1,2,3 and 4 and we all were occupying double seats as single rooms were given to final year students. The food was quite good and 4 meals every day, Purely vegetarian meals.Hostel no 5 was under construction a few years later when we reached 3rd yearv class, we were given single accommodation in Hostel no 5.
           
            <br><br> The academic session was a yearly one and we wre taught a fixed number of courses. The Institute was under Bihar University and later it came into Ranchi University. Annual Exam used to take place and results anniunced in News Papers. First Division with Distinction, First Division and Second Division were given. The faculty who taught us were really devoted and took teaching very seriously. Most of the Engineering teachers were only having Bachelors degree and very few with msters degree. 
             One or two had Ph.D. in Engineering. In science subjects facutly had Ph.D. degree.The laboratory facilities and workshop was adequate for good training. Overall the teaching was very good. The Institute had good sports infrastructure and we could play football, volleyball, cricket, Tennis, Badminton etc. There used to be annual day program spread over fwe days and evenings were full music, skits, drama , etc. .For enertainment students club used to show movie every week end although on a small projector 16mm. 
             Otherwise students used to go to Ranchi Town to see a movie. The going to Ranchi town was not easy as Institue Bus used to play on fixed time only. There were no placement cell those days. Students had to manage their own employment after graduation. But some state Governents were sent the names of successful students and they received direct employment in Government departments.
             
             The institute had a small clinic where a Doctor used to be available in morning anf evening.Some basic medicines used to be abvilable.
             
             Fromour batch many went abroad for higher studies and some went for work too. 
             
             <br><br> Overall it had been a good experience of our student days. We had our Golden Jubilee in 2013 and now looking forward to have Diamond Jubilee in 2023.
